# Amazon VPC Lattice - EC2 Instance & IP target type

![EC2 Instance & IP target](../../../../images/centralizedOutbound.png)

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed

## Code Principles:
- Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Provide a `custom_domain_name`, `certificate_arn`, and `hosted_zone_name` to test the creation of a VPC Lattice service with a custom domain name. We recommend the use of a [terraform.tfvars](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables) file.
- (Optional) Edit other variables under variables.tf file in the project root directory - if you want to test with different parameters.
- Deploy the resources using `terraform apply`.
- Remember to clean up resoures once you are done by using `terraform destroy`.

**Note** EC2 instances will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for each VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.
