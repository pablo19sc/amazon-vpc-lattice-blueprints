# Amazon VPC Lattice - EC2 Instance Targets (Terraform)

![EC2 Instance & IP target](../../../images/pattern1_architecture1.png)

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: With appropriate IAM permissions
- **Terraform**: >= 1.3.0 installed
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with credentials (optional, for verification)
- **ACM Certificate**: (Optional) For custom domain name configuration
- **Route 53 Hosted Zone**: (Optional) For custom domain name configuration
- **Permissions required**:
  - VPC Lattice: Service networks, services, target groups
  - EC2: VPC, subnets, instances, security groups
  - IAM: Create roles and policies
  - Route 53: (Optional) Hosted zone management
  - ACM: (Optional) Certificate management

## Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-vpc-lattice-blueprints.git

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd patterns/1-simple_architectures/1-ec2_instance/terraform

# Configure custom domain name
# (Recommended) Create terraform.tfvars to set:
# - custom_domain_name
# - certificate_arn
# - hosted_zone_name

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# (Optional) Review the planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy the resources
terraform apply
```

> **Note**: EC2 instances will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for the VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Destroy all resources
terraform destroy
```

## Testing

After deployment, follow the testing steps in the [Pattern 1 - EC2 Instance Testing Connectivity section](../README.md#testing-connectivity) to verify connectivity between consumer and provider instances through both VPC Lattice services.

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying this pattern:

1. **Test connectivity**: Follow the testing guide to verify both services work correctly.
2. **Explore other targets**: Try [Auto Scaling Group](../../2-auto_scaling_group/), [Lambda](../../3-lambda_function/), or [ECS](../../4-ecs/) patterns.
3. **Multi-Account**: Move to [Multi-Account patterns](../../../2-multi_account/) for cross-account deployments.
4. **Advanced architectures**: Explore [Advanced patterns](../../../3-advanced_architectures/) for more complex scenarios.
