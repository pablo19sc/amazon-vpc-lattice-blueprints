# Amazon VPC Lattice - AWS Lambda target

![EC2 Instance & IP target](../../../../images/pattern1_architecture3.png)

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with an IAM user with the appropriate permissions
- Terraform installed

## Code Principles:
- Writing DRY (Do No Repeat Yourself) code using a modular design pattern

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- (Optional) Edit the variables under variables.tf file in the project root directory - if you want to test with different parameters.
- Deploy the resources using `terraform apply`.
- Remember to clean up resoures once you are done by using `terraform destroy`.

**Note** EC2 instances will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for each VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.
