# Amazon VPC Lattice - Amazon ECS Target (Terraform)

![ECS target](../../../images/pattern1_architecture4.png)

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: With appropriate IAM permissions
- **Terraform**: >= 1.3.0 installed
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with credentials
- **Docker**: Installed and running on your local machine
- **Permissions required**:
  - VPC Lattice: Service networks, services, target groups
  - EC2: VPC, subnets, security groups, VPC endpoints
  - ECS: Clusters, task definitions, services
  - ECR: Repository management, image push/pull
  - IAM: Create roles and policies
  - CloudWatch: Log groups

## Deployment

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

Use the provided `deploy.sh` script for a streamlined deployment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-vpc-lattice-blueprints.git

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd patterns/1-simple_architectures/4-ecs/terraform

# Run the automated deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

The script automatically:

1. Deploys the ECR repository
2. Detects your system architecture (ARM64 or X86_64)
3. Builds and pushes the Docker image with matching architecture
4. Deploys the remaining infrastructure (VPC, ECS, VPC Lattice)

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Deployment

If you prefer manual control over each step:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-vpc-lattice-blueprints.git

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd patterns/1-simple_architectures/4-ecs/terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Deploy ECR repository only
terraform apply -target=aws_ecr_repository.ecr_repository

# Get repository URL
export REPOSITORY_URL=$(terraform output -raw repository_url)

# Build and push Docker image
REGION=$(echo $REPOSITORY_URL | cut -d'.' -f4)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $REPOSITORY_URL | cut -d'.' -f1)
PLATFORM=$(uname -m)

if [ "$PLATFORM" = "arm64" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "aarch64" ]; then
    DOCKER_PLATFORM="--platform linux/arm64"
else
    DOCKER_PLATFORM="--platform linux/amd64"
fi

aws ecr get-login-password --region ${REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com

cd ../application
docker build ${DOCKER_PLATFORM} -t ${REPOSITORY_URL}:latest .
docker push ${REPOSITORY_URL}:latest
cd ../terraform

# Deploy remaining infrastructure
terraform apply
```

> **Note**: The Terraform configuration automatically detects your system architecture and configures the ECS task definition accordingly. The Docker image must be built for the same architecture. EC2 instances and ECS Fargate will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for the VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Destroy all resources
terraform destroy
```

> **Note**: The ECR repository is configured with `force_delete = true`, so it will be deleted even if it contains images.

## Testing

After deployment, follow the testing steps in the [Pattern 1 - ECS Testing Connectivity section](../../README.md#4-ecs-fargate) to verify connectivity between consumer instances and ECS tasks through VPC Lattice.

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying this pattern:

1. **Test connectivity**: Follow the testing guide to verify both services work correctly.
2. **Explore other targets**: Try [Auto Scaling Group](../../2-auto_scaling_group/), [Lambda](../../3-lambda_function/), or [ECS](../../4-ecs/) patterns.
3. **Multi-Account**: Move to [Multi-Account patterns](../../../2-multi_account/) for cross-account deployments.
4. **Advanced architectures**: Explore [Advanced patterns](../../../3-advanced_architectures/) for more complex scenarios.
