# Amazon VPC Lattice Blueprints - Simple architectures

Within this section of the blueprints, we will cover a simple architecture: a consumer EC2 instance in a VPC consuming a VPC Lattice service or VPC resource in another VPC. Each sub-folder within this section will cover a different target type:

- [EC2 instances](./1-ec2_instance/) (using instance and IP targets)
<!-- - Auto-scaling group.
- AWS Lambda function.
- Amazon ECS.
- Amazon EKS.
- Amazon RDS instance. -->

**All examples are configured to be deployed in a single AWS Account**. For multi-AWS Account examples, please check the [Multi-account patterns](../2-multi_account/).

For the examples targeting a VPC Lattice service, two services will be created showing the use of the VPC Lattice generated FQDN and the custom domain name. Both services will use an HTTPS listener, so in the case of the custom domain name you need to provide an ACM certificate ARN.

##Â EC2 instance (using instance and IP target)

In this example, EC2 instances (1 per AZ) are the VPC Lattice targets. The following resources are created:

* Consumer VPC with EC2 instances (1 per AZ) as consumers, and an [EC2 Instance Connect endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-using-eice.html) to access the consumer instances.
* Provider VPC with EC2 instances (1 per AZ) as web servers.
* VPC Lattice resources:
    * 3 target groups, all them targeting the same EC2 instances. The difference is the target type: `INSTANCE` (target1), `IPv4` (target2), and `IPv6` (target3).
    * 2 VPC Lattice services with HTTPS listener. One of the services (`service1`) with a default forward action to `target1` (100% weight), and the other service (`service2`) with another default action to `target2` and `target3` (50% weight each).

**Note**: An [egress-only Internet gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.html) is created in the provider VPC to allow the EC2 instances to install the packages needed to be configured as web servers. IPv6 is used to not have any extra infrastructure cost (NAT gateways), and provide an easy configure for egress access.
